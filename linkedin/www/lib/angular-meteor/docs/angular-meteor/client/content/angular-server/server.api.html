# Building Server Side API

Angular services on the server side can be used to expose api to the client side just like
`Meteor.methods` are used. Using Angular services to expose server side api is more modular since the methods
are inherently namespaced unlike `Meteor.methods`. Apart from being more modular, calling server methods using
Angular services is more angular-friendly and easier when coming from the world of angular.

To expose API from the server to the clients we first have to create a service that will hold the
functions we want to expose to the world:

    // server/api/calculator.js
    angular.module('myApp').service('Calculator', function() {
      this.add = function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
      };
    });

The service does not have to do anything special in it's definition to become an API to the client. The
`Calculator` service can be called from server side code just like any other service.

Now we need to tell angular-meteor to expose this service as an API to our client. We do that using the
`ServerAPIProvider`. Using this provider we register our service as an API:

    // server/api/apis.js
    angular.module('myApp').config(function(ServerAPIProvider) {
      ServerAPIProvider.register('Calculator');
    });

After that is done the service is now exposed to clients as an API. That means that in our client side
we now have a service called `Calculator` that has the exact same methods as the service in the server,
but when calling the functions of the service we will get a promise as the return value and not the actual
return value of the server function. The promise that we get will resolve with the value that the server
function returns.

Example usage:

    // client/controllers/main.js
    angular.module('myApp').controller('MainCtrl', function(Calculator) {
      $scope.currentResult = 0;

      $scope.add = function(value) {
        Calculator.add($scope.currentResult, value).then(function(result) {
          $scope.currentResult = result;
        });
      };
    });

An important note is that if the service that was registered as an API is in common code (also defined on the client)
the call to the service function will call the client function and the server function both using the client function
as a stub. That is the same expected result when using a `Meteor.method`.
