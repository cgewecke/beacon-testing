# Bootstrapping Angular-Server

To enjoy the benefits of Angular on the server side, the first thing we have to do
is bootstrap our application.

That is no different from bootstrapping an Angular application on the client side, though
the only exception is that we cannot use the `ng-app` directive to bootstrap our application
automatically. So we will need use the `angular.bootstrap` function to manually bootstrap
our application. Anywhere in your server code, just call `angular.bootstrap` but without specifying
an element to bootstrap with (because we are on the server of course).

For example:

    // server/startup.js
    angular.bootstrap(['todoMVC']);

Once the application is bootstrapped the application runs the same as it would in the client side.
Meaning you would first have the `config` phase of the application bootstrap and then the `run` phase.
You can use these phases for server configuration and startup logic, but with the advantage of running inside
Angular's context giving you access to dependency injection.
