## Folder structure

When developing an angular app, it's best to structure your client side according to the angular components types.
The following structure is our suggestion for an angular 1 app using angular2now.

- client/
  - components/
    - comp1/
      - comp1.js
      - comp1.html
    - comp2/
      - comp2.js
      - comp2.html
  - services/
    - service1.js
    - service2.js
  - filters/
    - filter1.js
    - filter2.js
  - bootstrap.js

This structure is quite similar to an angular 2 project structure.
